# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Folder structure

All solutions will be in this one repository. Input and test data for each day is in folder `data`.

## Language

Right now, I plan to do all challenges with Rust. Pulling the repository and running `cargo run` will build the crate and calculate all solutions I have done so far.

## Tests

Tests can be run with `cargo test`. Tests are included in the source-file of the code they are testing.
